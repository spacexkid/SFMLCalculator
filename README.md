# SFMLCalculator
A simple sfml calculator I made to learn the basics of SFML. WARNING! My code is very sloppy and spaghetti.

I know I should've used inheritance for the button classes, but by the time I thought of doing that I already had two button classes and I was too lazy to go back and rewrite the code to have the buttons inherit a base class.
