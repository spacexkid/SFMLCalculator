# SFMLCalculator
A simple sfml calculator I made to learn the basics of SFML. WARNING! My code is very sloppy and spaghetti.

I know I should've used inheritance for the button classes, but by the time I thought of doing that I already had two button classes and I was too lazy to go back and rewrite the code to have the buttons inherit a base class.

Also the calculator is kinda finicky. In order to preform an operation you need to click the two numbers you want to do an operation on and then click the operation. After that you click the equal sign to get your result. You press CE after and it will clear it, but pressing equal updates window to show the output has been cleared.
